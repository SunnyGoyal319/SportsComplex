                                   <p>Swimming is an activity that burns lots of calories, is easy on the joints, supports your weight, builds muscular strength and endurance. It also improves cardiovascular fitness, cools you off and refreshes you in summer, and is one that you can do safely into old age. In this article, I'll review the history of swimming, the benefits, the strokes, how to get started, what to wear, the equipment you need, where to swim, and more.</p>

                                   <p>The roots of hockey are buried deep in antiquity. Historical records show that a crude form of the game was played in Egypt 4,000 years ago and in Ethiopia around 1,000BC, whilst an ancient form of the game was also played in Iran in around 2,000BC. The inaugural Olympic Hockey Competition for men was held in London in 1908 with England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales competing separately. With the addition of Germany and France, the competition ran with six teams.</p>

                                    <br>
                                    <p>Different versions of badminton have been played for centuries, but it was the game of "Poona" in India that was the basis for the game of badminton we play today. In the 1860's a group of stationed British army officers learned the game and took it back with them from India. The game grew in popularity until 1895 when the Badminton Association of England was formed, along with the rules of game play that are used around the world even today. In order to play this form of badminton, certain equipment and facilities are needed.</p>

                                       <p>The badminton court should be 44 feet long by 22 feet wide if playing doubles, and 44 feet long by 17 feet wide for singles. If the facility is indoors, there needs to be enough height for the shuttlecock to be able to float across the net without hitting the ceiling. This height will vary depending on the strength of the players.</p>

                                       <p>Volleyball was invented in 1895 by William G. Morgan as a less-strenuous alternative to basketball for middle-aged men. The sport began as a loose conglomeration of several other sports, incorporating equipment and ideas from badminton, tennis and basketball. As the game developed, the court and equipment used became uniquely refined to meet the specific needs of the sport.</p>
